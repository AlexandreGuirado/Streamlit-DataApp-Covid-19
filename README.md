# Streamlit-DataApp-Covid-19


This is a covid 19 dataset project updated daily. Here I am using Streamlit to make a Data App on localhost.

To start the project, a good option is to use google colab, just click on the icon when opening.

Remember to follow the tokenization step by step, the ideal is to access https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken and create your authtoken for free, inserting the code below. So you will have no problems in deploying because other people are already using the token below simultaneously.
